		<p> In the youtube video clip "Humans Need Not Apply" the video talks about growing artificial inteligence and how in the near future we will all be out of jobs most likely because robots can do things better and more efficient than us.</p>

		<p> I feel like robots taking over is inveitable. Robots do everything that we can do way more efficiently and faster. What would be the use of humans if we have something that can do everything for us. Humans are lazy and robots are our solution. </p>

		<h4>Knowing Where You Are</h4>
		<p>A GPS can help locate whereever you are in the world.It can locate you not only on the map but in three dimensions.Photos can be stamped with information about where they were shot as well as when, where and with what camera.</p>

		<h4>Black Boxes Are Not Just For Airplanes Anymore</h4>
		<p>A black box or EDR (event data recorder) captures every detail about what happens before airplane crashes.EDR's are automotive black boxes.They can capture speed, braking time, turn signal status and even seat belts.</p>

		<h4>The Parking Garage Knows More Than You Think</h4>
		<p>Every single car entering a parking garage has its licence plate photographed.The only problem is that if two cars arrive and leave at the same time they may not be able to exit if the tickets are swapped.</p>
